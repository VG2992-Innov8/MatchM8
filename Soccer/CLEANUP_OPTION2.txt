Option 2 Cleanup â€” remove legacy audit routes/UI
================================================

Search your codebase for these patterns and delete them:

Backend (routes/middleware):
- Any route like: app.get('/api/audit'...), app.get('/audit/logs'...), app.post('/audit/log'...)
- Any custom middleware that sets/resolves an "audit" object for legacy handlers
- Any old CSV export endpoints you no longer want to keep

Frontend (Admin Tools page):
- Any second "Audit Log" panel or iframe that points to the old route
- Old buttons that hit legacy audit endpoints

Keep only:
- Unified GET /audit  (for admin visibility check)
- Your single Audit Viewer (the one you actually want to use)

After removal:
- Restart the server, hard refresh the browser
- Verify that /admin.html shows only one Audit section
